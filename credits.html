                <h1 class="title" style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Dear Oana,</h1>
                <p><br>First of all, I would like to thank you for coming into my life. It was one of the biggest blessings I have ever received from God. Every time I think of you, I can't help but smile and think of how lucky I am to have you.</p>
                <p>I had no expectations the first time we talked. I've been alone for months and I was just looking for someone to talk to, for someone who can relate to me, and who I can relate to. Someone who has the same humor as mine. Someone who is as smart as I am. Turns out you are more than that. Turns out, you have surpassed my standards.</p>
                <p>I love talking to you. I love being with you. I love how you make me feel loved. I love how you make me feel that you always care. I love that there is you in my life.</p>
                <p><em>Hindi ko inakalang sa'yo ko pala mararanasan at mararamdaman lahat ng dati ay inakala kong malabo.</em></p>
                <p>Nobody's perfect, we all know that. But you are an exception. <em>Youuuuuu areeee the only exceptionnnnn~</em> Okay, hear me out. You may not be perfect, but I can see, and I can feel, and I believe, and I know, that you are my perfect pair. Corny man pero totoo. Tayo yung John Lloyd and Bea na hanggang dulo.</p>
                <p>You are sweet, caring, thoughtful, understanding, patient, affectionate, clingy, and loving. Everything. Baka maubusan na ako ng hininga, hindi pa rin maubos lahat ng adjectives na ginawa talaga para ialay sa'yo. You are beautiful in everything you do, in every word you say, and in every moment we share together.</p>
                <p>Love, I may not be perfect for you right now, but I promise to be better for you. Please don't give up on me because I will never give up on you. Please stay just like how I will stay through the bad times. We will conquer everything. Just hold my hand and never let me go.</p>
                <p><em>Mahal na mahal kita, Oana. At hindi na magbabago 'yon.</em></p>
                <p>Oana,</p>
